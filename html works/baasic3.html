    <p><strong>Marxism </strong>Marxism is a method of socioeconomic
        analysis that uses a materialist interpretation of historical development,
        better known as historical materialism, to understand class relations and social conflict as well as a
        dialectical perspective to view social transformation. It originates from the works of 19th-century German
        philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. As Marxism has developed over time into various branches and
        schools of thought, currently no single, definitive Marxist theory exists.[1]

        Some Marxist schools of thought place greater emphasis on certain aspects of classical Marxism while rejecting
        or modifying other aspects. Some schools have sought to combine Marxian concepts and non-Marxian concepts which
        has then led to widely varying conclusions.[2]
