                        <p class="card-text">are extremely popular pets because these micro dogs look like puppies
                            forever. It's no wonder they can fetch thousands of dollars apiece. In general, teacups are
                            markedly smaller than their breed standard and are not recognized by the American Kennel
                            Club. Ethics come into question with these dogs since, in most cases, they are the runts or
                            weakest of their litter and then are usually bred with other smaller or weaker dogs. </p>

                            compact dogs are a part of the American Kennel Club’s Toy group, and are known as the clowns
                            of the canine world because they have a great sense of humor and like to show off.

                            Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue
                            groups. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.
